# visual-inertial-slam
Implemented simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), leveraging extended Kalman filter for estimating the SLAM pose of a moving car and landmark positions in its surroundings.

## Data utilized:
1. IMU: Linear acceleration and angular velocity.
2. Stereo-camera images: Left-right camera pixel values of labelled landmarks throughout the car's journey.
<br>For data related queries, contact rkgutta266@gmail.com

## Tasks:
1. Estimating the path taken by the car as well as showing the landmarks seen from the car during the journey. <br>
**Results:** Deadreckon and estimated trajectories shown together for two different datasets <br>
